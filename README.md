Basic Git, GitHub, and Students
=========

Git, GitHub, and Students is how we collaborate together during class. Exercises, such as this one, are how we submit work for the rest of class.

In this exercise we'll re-inforce several `git` concepts and learn how to submit work. Work individually on this. If you finish, help other students.
