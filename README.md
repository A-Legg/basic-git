Basic Git, GitHub, and Students
=========

Git, GitHub, and Students is how we collaborate together during class. Exercises, such as this one, are how we submit work for the rest of class.

In this exercise we'll re-inforce several `git` concepts and learn how to submit work. Work individually on this. If you finish, help other students.

## Tech skills learned

* Git
* GitHub

## Resources

* [Git Documentation](http://git-scm.com/documentation)
* [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book)

## Tasks

1. Fork this repository.
1. Create a file called hello.txt.
1. Make a commit with this file.
1. Push this change to GitHub.
1. Add the text "hello world" to line 1 in the file hello.txt.
1. Make a commit with this change.
1. Push this change to GitHub.
1. Ask for an instructor to review your work.
1. Redirect the output from `git log` into a file called `git-log.txt`. NO TEXT EDITORS!.
1. Commit this file with the contents using `git add -p`.
1. Push this change to GitHub.
1. Ask for an instructor to review your work.
1. Log into students and create a submission for this exercise.
1. Fork this repository to the other person's account. Clone this code to the other computer.
1. On the original repository add "I hope this makes it!" on line 2 to the `hello.txt`.
1. On the newly forked repository add "Oh no! What's going to happen?" on line 2 to the `hello.txt`.
1. Make a commit on the first computer.
1. Make a commit on the second computer.
1. Merge these two changes together so they both end up on both user's GitHub, on lines 1 and 2, respectively.
1. On one of the computers, over-write the old `git-log.txt` with the new output from `git log`.
1. Ask for an instructor to review your work

When you're finished, you should BOTH have a repository on GitHub that has two files in, `hello.txt` and `git-log.txt`.
`git-log.txt` contains the most recent output from `git log` and `hello.txt` looks like:
```
hello world
I hope this makes it!
Oh no! What's going to happen?
```

1. Draw the interactions between each pair's computer and github
